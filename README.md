# UW_Rpi_Camera

Personal Statement:
I'm a behavioral ecologist that studies the reproductive behavior and early life history of reef fishes. I have a background in biology and aquaculture, but minimal experience with electronics and coding.... so this should be fun. I have undertaken this project partly as a creative outlet / means of catharsis while finishing my dissertation, and partly to fill a research need within my community.

Project Background: 
A central focus of animal behavior is understanding the physical and behavioral mechanisms that determine how far baby reef fish move away from their parents. (expand)

Rationale: 
This question is important because we use this information to determine how far apart we should space marine reserves, which are the equivalent of underwater parks that help to protect and restore fish populations. (expand)

Project Goal: 
To address this question we must understand the behavioral abilities of reef fish from the time of hatching, through dispersal away from their parents, and eventual return to select habitat on the reef. However, observing the behavior of fish underwater is logistically difficult. Divers can typically spend just 3-4 hours a day underwater, and exhale large bubbles that may disrupt fish behavior. Cameras are the logical alternative to direct observations. However, underwater cameras are often bulky, expensive, and lack the functionality required by behavioral ecologist working in the marine environment. In addition, camera equipment that is deployed underwater for long periods of time is often lost to malfunction, inclement weather, and theft. Given that most low-end underwater cameras on the market cost between $200 - 500 USD, a camera with functionality taylored to data collection that costs < $100 USD would be a valuable addition to marine science. 

Objective:
The objective of this project is to build a camera that meets the following criteria: i) waterproof to >60', ii) battery life lasting 24hrs, iii) timelapse photo and video, iv) day and night functionality (IR illumination and sensitivity), v) the ability to record and store data from sensors (e.g., light, temperature, pressure), and finally, vi) < $100 USD. 

# This project is an attempt to meet these criteria using a raspberry-pi, Rpi No-IR camera, and various off the shelf sensors.
